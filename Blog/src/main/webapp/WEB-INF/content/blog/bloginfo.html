            	<p id="congrats">If you're seeing this page via a web browser, it means you've setup Tomcat successfully. Congratulations!</p>

          <p>As you may have guessed by now, this is the default Tomcat home page. It can be found on the local filesystem at:</p>
          <p class="code">$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/index.html</p>

          <p>where "$CATALINA_HOME" is the root of the Tomcat installation directory. If you're seeing this page, and you don't think you should be, then you're either a user who has arrived at new installation of Tomcat, or you're an administrator who hasn't got his/her setup quite right. Providing the latter is the case, please refer to the <a href="/docs">Tomcat Documentation</a> for more detailed setup and administration information than is found in the INSTALL file.</p>

            <p><b>NOTE: For security reasons, using the manager webapp
            is restricted to users with certain roles such as "manager-gui".</b>
            Users are defined in <code>$CATALINA_HOME/conf/tomcat-users.xml</code>.</p>

            <p>Included with this release are a host of sample Servlets and JSPs (with associated source code), extensive documentation, and an introductory guide to developing web applications.</p>

            <p>Tomcat mailing lists are available at the Tomcat project web site:</p>

           <ul>
               <li><b><a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html#tomcat-users">tomcat-users</a></b> for general questions related to configuring and using Tomcat</li>
               <li><b><a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html#tomcat-dev">tomcat-dev</a></b> for developers working on Tomcat</li>
           </ul>

            <p>Thanks for using Tomcat!</p>

            <p>While we've done our best to ensure that these documents are clearly
            written and easy to understand, we may have missed something.  Provided
            below are various web sites and mailing lists in case you get stuck.</p>
            
            <p>As Tomcat 6 is a new release of Tomcat, keep in mind that some of the
            issues and solutions vary between the major versions of Tomcat (4.x versus
            5).  As you search around the web, there will be some documentation that
            is not relevant to Tomcat 6, but 3.x, 4.x and 5.x.  Doing 3.x or 4.x things to 6
            will probably not work in most cases as the server.xml files are very
            different.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Current document - most documents will list potential hangups. Be sure
                to fully read the relevant documentation as it will save you much time
                and effort. There's nothing like scouring the web only to find out that
                the answer was right in front of you all along!</li>
            <li><a href="http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/FAQ">Tomcat FAQ</a> as maintained by the developers.</li>
            <li><a href="http://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat WIKI</a></li>

            <li>Tomcat mailing list archives - numerous sites archive the Tomcat mailing
                lists. Since the links change over time, clicking here will search
                <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=tomcat+mailing+list+archives">Google</a>.
                </li>
            <li>The TOMCAT-USER mailing list, which you can subscribe to
                <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html">here</a>. If you don't
                get a reply, then there's a good chance that your question was probably
                answered in the list archives or one of the FAQs.  Although questions
                about web application development in general are sometimes asked and
                answered, please focus your questions on Tomcat-specific issues.</li>
            <li>The TOMCAT-DEV mailing list, which you can subscribe to
                <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html">here</a>.  This list is
                <strong>reserved</strong> for discussions about the development of Tomcat
                itself.  Questions about Tomcat configuration, and the problems you run
                into while developing and running applications, will normally be more
                appropriate on the TOMCAT-USER list instead.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>And, if you think something should be in the docs, by all means let us know
            on the TOMCAT-DEV list, or send one of the doc authors email.</p>
